“All work presented is my own, and I have followed all rules for collaboration.”

I worked with Jonathan Burger
```{r}
library(devtools)
library(tidyverse)
library(uszipcodes)
library(maps)
library(leaflet)

uscities <- maps::us.cities

capitals <- uscities %>% filter(capital == 2)
view(capitals)


content <- capitals %>%
  mutate(popup = paste0(name))

capital_map <- leaflet(capitals) %>%
  setView(lng = -98.583, lat = 39.833, zoom = 4) %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$Wikimedia) %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = capitals$long, lat = capitals$lat,
             clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions(),
             popup = content$popup)
capital_map
```
