“All work presented is my own. I have not communicated with or worked with anyone else on this quiz.”

Question 1:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
alcohol_df <- read_csv(here("data/alcohol.csv"))
alcohol_df
```
```{r}
library(gridExtra)
world <- map_data("world")

world_beer <- left_join(world, alcohol_df, by = c("region" = "country"))

ggplot(data = world_beer, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(colour = "black", aes(fill = beer_servings)) +
  coord_map(projection = "mercator") +
  theme_void() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c()

```

Question 2:
How have alcohol trends changed since the start of the pandemic?
I would create a scatterplot with a line of best fit to see if the alcohol trends have incerased or decreased since the pandemic. The x axis would have year and the y would have total liters of pure alcohol.
